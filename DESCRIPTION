Description: Provides tools for decomposing differences in rate metrics
    between two groups into contributions from individual subgroups and
    visualizing them as a "Theseus Plot". Inspired by the story of the
    Ship of Theseus, the method replaces subgroup data from one group with
    that of another step by step, recalculating the overall metric at each
    stage to quantify subgroup contributions.  A Theseus Plot combines the
    stepwise progression of a waterfall plot with the comparative bars of
    a bar chart, offering an intuitive way to understand subgroup-level
    effects.
