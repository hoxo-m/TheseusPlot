However, type analysis challenging metric rate, magnitude subgroup’s contribution rate simply calculated, unlike case volume metrics. address issue, propose approach inspired story Ship Theseus. approach involves gradually replacing components one group another, recalculating metric step. change metric step can interpreted contribution subgroup overall difference. instance, suppose metric 6.2% 2024 decreased 5.2% 2025. , focus gender. replace male data within 2024 dataset male data 2025 recalculate metric. result, metric drop 0.8 percentage points, reaching 5.4%. case, contribution male group change metric -0.8 percentage points. Next, replace female data 2024 2025. dataset consists entirely 2025 data, metric drops 0.2 percentage points, reaching 5.2%. Thus, contribution female group -0.2 percentage points. visualized, results appear follows:  plot, can see decline metric primarily driven male group. call visualization “Theseus Plot.” TheseusPlot package designed make easy generate Theseus Plots various attributes.","code":"#> Warning: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0. #> ℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`. #> ℹ See also `vignette(\"ggplot2-in-packages\")` for more information. #> ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the waterfalls package. #>   Please report the issue to the authors. #> This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. #> Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was #> generated."},{"path":"https://hoxo-m.github.io/TheseusPlot/index.html","id":"id_2-installation","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"2.
